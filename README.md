## 🧱 Database Schema

Ensure you're using **Oracle SQL** and create the following tables before running the application. These SQL commands reflect the correct parent-child relationships:

```sql
-- Create User Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(255),
    email VARCHAR2(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR2(255),
    role VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Create Group Table
CREATE TABLE groups (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(255),
    description VARCHAR2(255),
    admin_id NUMBER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create UserGroup Table (for mapping members to groups)
CREATE TABLE user_group (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id NUMBER,
    group_id NUMBER,
    accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id)
);

-- Create Expense Table
CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id NUMBER,
    amount FLOAT,
    description VARCHAR2(255),
    paid_by NUMBER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (paid_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create Expense Split Table
CREATE TABLE expense_split (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    expense_id NUMBER,
    user_id NUMBER,
    amount FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (expense_id) REFERENCES expenses(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create Settlement Table
CREATE TABLE settlements (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    payer_id NUMBER,
    receiver_id NUMBER,
    amount FLOAT,
    group_id NUMBER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (payer_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (receiver_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id)
);

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-manager.git
cd expense-manager
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
```

- Import the project into **Spring Tool Suite** or **IntelliJ**
- Set Oracle DB credentials in `application.properties`
- Run the Spring Boot application (`ExpenseBackendApplication.java`)

### 3. Frontend Setup

## 🔐 Default Admin Credentials

You can hardcode or seed an initial admin user directly into your database for testing.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role)
VALUES ('Admin', 'admin@example.com', 'hashed-password-here', 'ADMIN');
```

Make sure you hash the password using your Spring Security configuration.
